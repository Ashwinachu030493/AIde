# Archived Infrastructure

These files were part of the initial PostgreSQL/Docker architecture.

## Why Archived?
1. Development complexity: Docker issues on Windows
2. User feedback: Simplicity preferred for local tool
3. Performance: SQLite sufficient for single-user local app

## If You Need Docker Later:
1. Review archived docker-compose.yml
2. Update database schemas for PostgreSQL
3. Consider using SQLite in Docker for consistency
